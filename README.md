# project-shino
This project includes the use of meta ai to make a new ai named shino who can give answers with the help of meta ai. It can also search for files in local directory and also build up a memory database of its past interactions, Users can also configue what this ai can do by simply customizing its prompt in "ai.py". this project is currently in development as me, being a student and a rather quiet student in my school. you are free to commit any changes as long as it doesn't cause harm to other users. Or you can just use this ai as inspiration to make your own.  
Just a project for my school. You are free to look around, Clone or you this repo as Your wish
